      <p>Nearly 6 years ago, I "developed" a how-to internal webpage for my team by hyperlinking a couple of Word documents, converting them into HTML format, and saving them on a network share. I'd have to say that was one of the most satisfying accomplishments as an IT professional, and it's the reason why I'm ready to start this next phase of my career in IT as a web developer</p>
